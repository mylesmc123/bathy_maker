# Bathymetry Maker

Given an outline polygon, such as a lake or reservoir, and an estimate Elevation-Area table, this script will create a contour shapefile, buffering the lake surface down to match the Elevation-Area table. This can be useful for Hydraulic Modeling when you only have the lake surface in the terrain with no bathymetry data.
